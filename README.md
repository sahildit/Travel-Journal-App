# Travel-Journal-App
This app is travel journal app where people can find about different activities, beaches, etc and this idea came from when I went to my family in India. It was done in an language called java.
So my app starts with Home Screen where I have 5 buttons ( Explore, About me, Members, overview, extras) 

Explore – have 5 more buttons (Beaches, Place of Interest, Activities, Location and reviews). It
Basically like if user clicks on beaches then another activity gonna pop-up which have a list View for different beaches  and if user wants they can even go further and click on any listItem ( its same for BEACH, ACTIVITIES and PLACE OF INTEREST).

User can also find location of anything If they wants to and also can add their review if they seems to have any concerns regarding app info.(That’s Database for adding revivews)

About me – Basically have my photo and a textView which talks little about me.

Members -this class  using database for adding and deleting members(well for Students).

Overview – This is used to show overview of app via Video( took video from Youtube).

Extras – has calender and Camera features (Image and Video) which is used.
